# BayesianLongTermFactorModeling
This is the code for our article: A Note on Bayesian long-term factor modeling of the stock market. 
See FMR7 and FMR8 for the 3-factor model; see 1Y-nomreturn-all, 10Y-nomreturn-all, 1Y-realreturn-all, 10Y-realreturn-all for the 1-factor model. Other files are just archive. In particular, FMRQ-Qplot is the code to make QQ plots for AR and ARMA modeling.
This attempt to get normal residuals by Lissa Callahan failed.
